  <h1>Official Kirkar Minecraft Server</h1>
  <p>
    (Sorry if this looks crappy, I coded it myself...)<br><br>
    Hey there! Here is the official tutorial for the Kirkar Server.<br>
    <br>
    <div id="Purpose">
      <h2>Server Purpose</h2>
      NationStates is an amazing Nation Simulator, where you create a nation,<br>
      then you make decisions by solving issues, vote on world problems, interact<br>
      with other nations, and lots more.<br>
      <br>
      But, wouldn't it be nice to actually see the nation itself? Well, now you can.<br>
      We've created this minecraft server to be able to visualize Kirkar (and Kirkar only).<br>
      Come play with us!

    <div id="Tutorial">
      <h2>Server Tutorial</h2>
      Well if we build a beautiful palace, we don't want someone else coming in and<br>
      destroying it, do we? Well, we have a solution to that.<br>
      <br>
      If you'd rather watch a short, 3 minute video, click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDsjXB-BaE0&index=1&list=PL6diNfcl9_VzUvUvQWrDsQfYoSs3Oizly">here</a> to see it.<br>
      <br>
      You know what, I don't want to explain it. Watch the video. It's useful.<br>
      <br>
      Golden Shovels will be available at spawn. You'll know what that means after you watch the video.
    </div>
    <div id="Play">
      <h2>Come Play!</h2>
      Well, to make sure no random people join our server and build random crap, I've made it so<br>
      that only people I allow can join (aka added a whitelist). To be allowed to join, send me a <br>
      Telegram on NationStates with your minecraft username, and I'll add you as soon as I can!<br>
      <br>
      After I've added you, I'll give you the IP. This is just an extra level of protection so that<br>
      not everyone in the world knows the IP to the server.
