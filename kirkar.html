  <h1>Official Kirkar Minecraft Server</h1>
  <p>
    (Sorry if this looks crappy, I coded it myself...)<br><br>
    Hey there! Here is the official tutorial for the Kirkar Server.<br>
    <br>
    <div id="Purpose">
      <h2>Server Purpose</h2>
      NationStates is an amazing Nation Simulator, where you create a nation,<br>
      then you make decisions by solving issues, vote on world problems, interact<br>
      with other nations, and lots more.<br>
      <br>
      But, wouldn't it be nice to actually see the nation itself? Well, now you can.<br>
      We've created this minecraft server to be able to visualize Kirkar (and Kirkar only).<br>
      Come play with us!

      <h2>Server Tutorial</h2>
      Well if we build a beautiful palace, we don't want someone else coming in and<br>
      destroying it, do we? Well, we have a solution to that.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>Survival (/warp survival)</h3>
      (WorldEdit is off in Survival)<br>
      <b>BE SURE TO USE /KIT TOOLS IN SURVIVAL, NOT CREATIVE! YOU CAN ONLY USE IT ONCE!</b><br>
      <br>
      I command you to watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDsjXB-BaE0&index=1&list=PL6diNfcl9_VzUvUvQWrDsQfYoSs3Oizly">video</a>. But seriously, watch it.<br>
      <br>
      After watching the video you will know what this means:<br>
      - You start off with 1,000 claim blocks.<br>
      - You earn 5 claim blocks for every hour you play.<br>
      - You can earn up to 5,000 claim blocks.<br>
      - Golden Shovels will be available at spawn.<br>
      <h3>Creative (/warp creative)</h3>
      (WorldEdit is on in Creative, within your own plot)<br>
      <br>
      <b>SOME INFO ABOUT WORLDEDIT:</b><br>
      As you know, WorldEdit can get very laggy and sometimes even crash the server.<br>
      To solve this problem, I've made it gradually add the blocks, instead of loading them in all at once.<br>
      So, <b>if you edited something and it didn't show up, don't try to do it again</b>, it's probably loading in gradually.<br>
      <br>
      The creative part to this server is on a plot system. Everyone gets to have 2 80x80 plots.<br>
      If you want, you can merge your plots if they are next to each other, by doing /p merge [direction].<br>
      To claim the plot you are standing on, use /p claim.<br>
      To automatically retrieve a plot for you, use /p auto.<br>
      To clear your plot, use /p clear.<br>
      You can see all the other commands by doing /p help.<br>
      <br><br>
      <br>
      <b>Thats it! Go ahead and join! If you have any questions, contact Leo H somehow.</b>
    </div>
    <div id="Play">
      <h2>Come Play!</h2>
      Well, to make sure no random people join our server and build random crap, I've made it so<br>
      that only people I allow can join (aka added a whitelist). To be allowed to join, send Leo H (Giant Potato) a <br>
      Telegram on NationStates with your minecraft username, and I'll add you as soon as I can!<br>
      <br>
      After I've added you, I'll give you the IP. This is just an extra level of protection so that<br>
      not everyone in the world knows the IP to the server.
