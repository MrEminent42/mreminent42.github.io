You're receiving this letter because you are someone who made my life better in so many ways. Even thinking of life without you... well I can't even think about it, because its unimaginable. I think we can all agree that 2016 wasn't the greatest year for a lot of us, and it was especially hard on me, since, you know, I moved across the world. I hope that, in some way, I added also something positive to your life. Whether it be one of my lame jokes, a YouTube video, or me leaving (I hope not -_-), it makes me happy to see you laugh and smile.

I also hope that you enjoy Christmas as much as I do this year. Spend time with your family, open presents, drink eggnog (or don't - it probably has alcohol), and relax. Christmas is what you make of it, and it won't come around for another 365 days, so make the most of it right now. If you want another gift for Christmas, I'm happy to give you a virtual hug. *hug* There you go. Merry Christmas.

Thank you again for being someone in my life, you're a huge reason I survived 2016.

Love,
Leo

P.S. Sorry for the pasted message lol, most chat clients won't let me send a message this long.</p>
