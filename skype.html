<p1>You should see a request to launch an external app. <br>
<br>
The reason you see this is because I am trying to open up Skype, <br>
so you can chat with me (MrEminent42).<br>
<br>
Please click "Launch Application" (or something similar) <br>
so you can chat with me!<br></p1>
<br>
If you don't see anything but this text, <br>
please and add <b>MrEminent42</b> as a contact in Skype.
